			  <p><em>EDITOR’S NOTE:</em> Cronkite News has removed this interview with a former police officer who spoke to Arizona Horizon host Ted Simons. After hearing feedback from our readers and student journalists, we recognize the piece did not include sufficient context, alternative viewpoints or a fact checking of the source’s comments. The decision to unpublish the piece in no way reflects on the student reporter’s work, but failings on my part – and in the newsroom’s editorial process. I apologize. Cronkite News faculty is working with students to evaluate how to cover these issues in ways that better serve and represent our communities, especially the black community and other communities of color. Those discussions include the story selection and approval process, social media messaging and the language we use.</p>
